# DynamoProgressBar

this is an in progress proof of concept of making a progress bar in dynamo.

---

Key considerations for this to be succesful:
1. Evaluates based on the nodes that need executed.
2. Does not hinder performance.
3. works in full Dynamo UI and potentially player.
4. Works in Core without any Revit dependencies.
